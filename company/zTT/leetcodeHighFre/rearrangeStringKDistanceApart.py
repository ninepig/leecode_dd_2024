         1. go through Task Scheduler problem first, https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/discuss/699297/Python-Very-detailed-explanation-with-examples
         2. Here the number of slots will be, Maximum freq number. ( consider a:4, b:4, c:4, d:2 )
         3. WATCH OUT, lets say for now there is no K given, fill all the slots. (Intially I was limiting my slot size to only k, question says minimum distance should be k, it doesn't matter if it is greater than k )
         4. a b c d
            a b c d
            a b c _
            a b c _
         5. another case: a:6, b:2, c:2 ( rearrange not possible )
            a b
            a b
            a c
            a c
            a
            a
         After filling the slots when you try to join them, slot5 and slot6 are not k-distant apart, so we return false.
         6. But edge case comes : a:3, b:2, c:1, e:1
            a b e
            a b
            a c
            This is wrong combination.
        If you carefully analyze, we donot actually care about last row if it has k characters or not. so we fill only till maxFreq - 1
            correct combination:
            a b c
            a b e
            a

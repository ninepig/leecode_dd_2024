'''
dp[i] means overall costs untill i-th day (included)
we have to check two conditions:

1. i in days list:
we have three option:
a) 1-pass: dp[i] = dp[i-1] + costs[0]
b) 7-pass: dp[i] = dp[i-7] + costs[1]
c) 30-pass: dp[i] = dp[i-30] + costs[2]
in order to avoid negative index:
a) 1-pass: dp[i] =dp[max(0,i-1)] + costs[0]
b) 7-pass: dp[i] = dp[max(0,i-7)] + costs[1]
c) 30-pass: dp[i] = dp[max(0,i-30)] + costs[2]
2. i not in days:
dp[i] = dp[i-1]
which simply means we don't have to spend money, and total costs remains same

A recently launched supplemental typing keypad gained significant popularity on Amazon Shopping due to its flexibility.

This keypad can be connected to any electronic device and has 9 buttons, where each button can have up to 3 lowercase English letters. The buyer has the freedom to choose which letters to place on a button while ensuring that the arrangement is valid. A keypad design is said to be valid if:

All 26 letters of the English alphabet exist on the keypad.
Each letter is mapped to exactly one button.
A button has at most 3 letters mapped to it.
